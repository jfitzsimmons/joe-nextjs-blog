Yet they accomplish much.”\\\n> ― Blaise Pasca\n\n[Bukowski’s Letter of Gratitude to the Man Who Helped Him Quit His Soul-Sucking Job and Become a Full-Time Writer](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/08/12/charles-bukowski-john-martin-letter/)\n\nThe bullet points I took from this were:\n\n* **Address their woes**\n* **Find commonality with your own concerns**\n* **Commiserate, show understanding**\n* **Thank them for something simple and personal.**\n* **Express how they know and understand you**\n* **Express how they make you better**\n* **If you talk about yourself, keep it short**\n* **Add some shared experience from your pasts**\n* **Share how you’re better because of them**\n* **A humble send off**\n\nYour yearn for a more thoughtful and loving world combined with the desire to communicate and be a resource for humanity is an inspiration.

I will thank you for that spark and not waste anymore of your time. \n\nThank you,\nP.S. remember that carriage accident we were in?\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal#The_Memorial\n\n> “To make light of philosophy is to be a true philosopher.”\\\n> ― Blaise Pascal, [Pensées](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3102980)\n\nYeah, we're both heros.\n\n> “To ridicule philosophy is really to philosophize.”\\\n> ― Blaise Pascal\n\nAlright, it's getting old.\n\n> “All men seek happiness. This is without exception. Whatever different means they employ, they all tend...\"\n\nSHUT UP!",

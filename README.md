# Insincere Engineer

## a site built with NextJS

A blog site that along with typical tags and categories, can also filter out individual fields from posts. I have a section for viewing all post references and filtering them further. I plan on adding the ability to filter by videos, photos, etc...
Part blog / part knowledge repository.
